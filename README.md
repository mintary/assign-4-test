To run the program, simply do ./build_test and then ./test

Remember to `chmod +x` build_test.

**NOTE: The member names in the database and record struct may not be the same as in your program, right now your only choice is to edit the struct members in the test file with your own member names, sorry!**

This reads from the file called "test-database-read.csv" so make sure that it's in the same directory. 

TBA:
1. A better way to ensure that the test works without needing to fiddle with moving functions 
2. Testing equality of CSV files automatically

Suggestions and improvements very much appreciated I have no idea what I'm doing in C :'))
